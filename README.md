# TestSocialNetwork
the
HAHAAHAHAHA DEEEEEZZAZZ

quick breakdown:
- only post once a day
- only one reply allowed
- tries to become more "intrusive" over time
- like 10 warnings when dming a person for the first time
- notifications are silent by default (first time guide will state this)

this entire project is aimed to make the least addictive social network while still keeping periodical engagement
